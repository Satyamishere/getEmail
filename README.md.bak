# getEmail

Tiny Gmail + Sheets + Slack demo. Backend handles Google OAuth and Gmail API calls; frontend is a small Vite React app that talks to the backend.

Quick local dev
1. Copy `.env.example` -> `.env` and fill in keys.
2. Start backend and frontend in separate terminals:

```powershell
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev

cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Deploy to Render
- I added a `render.yaml` that defines a `getemail-backend` web service and a `getemail-frontend` static site. Connect your GitHub repo to Render and it will follow the manifest.

Notes
- Re-authorize Google when you change scopes (Sheets scope needs consent).
- Keep `.env` secret; `.env` is in `.gitignore`.

If you want, I can open a PR with these changes or add more deployment options.
